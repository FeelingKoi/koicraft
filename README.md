# Koicraft
*A Minecraft Texture Pack*

## About Koicraft
### The Past

Koicraft was born out of sheer spite for the base Minecraft grey GUI, but I hope to evolve it into much more than that. Currently I am working on fully editing the GUI before branching out to other parts of the textures. I want to make some cute, and whimsical and fun, and hopefully have it as the foundation for a future mod-pack?
### The Present

Right now I've completed most of the 'Containers' section and I'm slowly branching out to the icons and widgets. I've also completed the title screen (although I intend to either make a higher quality logo or commission a better one) but most to all of the things I've done so far are very early stages. (I really don't intend to keep the title screen overlay THAT sketchy for this entire lifespan).
### The Future

End goal is to maybe make a fully-custom textured mod-pack that can work for my friend-hosted server. I want something that includes the whimsy and cuteness of the lore I'm building for the basis of my OC, and also feels especially like I made it. I'm not really looking for something intensely technical - that's not really my style - but I want to make a mod-pack that feels fun and wondrous, one that includes lots of creatures and magic. I'll probably focus mainly on including food + decoration mods, as that's the most enjoyable play-style for me personally, and the texture pack (and future mod-pack) is mainly for my enjoyment first, and released to the world second.
