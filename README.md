I hate the Grey UI

## what is this?
My dream is to one day have a modpack, but we're not there yet. Currently I am doing my best to make a texture pack based upon 1.20 Minecraft that I can build into a texture pack that I can use as the basis for a modpack. Baby steps, though, so I'm currently trying to edit and overwrite the UI.

## Can I use this?
You can use my work, as long as you properly credit me and link back to my main website, my ko-fi or my youtube / twitch channels. I would also appriciate some sort of notification but it is not mandatory.
